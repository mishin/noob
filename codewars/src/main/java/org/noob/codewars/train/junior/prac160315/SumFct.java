/**
 * The drawing shows 6 squares the sides of which have a length of 1, 1, 2, 3,
 * 5, 8. It's easy to see that the sum of the perimeters of these squares is : 4
 * * (1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8) = 4 * 20 = 80
 * 
 * Say that S(n) is the nth term of the above sum. So
 * 
 * S(0) = 1, S(1) = 1, S(2) = 2, ... , S(5) = 8
 * 
 * Could you give the sum S of the perimeters of all the squares in a rectangle
 * when there are n + 1 squares disposed in the same manner as in the drawing:
 * 
 * S = S(0) + S(1) + ... + S(n) ?
 * 
 * TODO finish
