 A triangle number is a number where n objects form an equilateral triangle (it's a bit hard to explain). For example, 6 is a triangle number because you can arrange 6 objects into an equilateral triangle:

  1
 2 3
4 5 6

8 is not a triangle number because 8 objects do not form an equilateral triangle:

   1
  2 3
 4 5 6
7 8 9 10
